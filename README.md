# Dry-Bean-Dataset-Model
Developed an efficient model in identifying classes of dry beans based on the dry bean dataset
In this project I developed an efficient model that was trained on the Dry Bean dataset to identify different classes of dry beans based on the features provided. I analyzed and visualized the dataset to provide insights for myself on the information that I am provided. I then made some initial assumptions about the correlations of different features of dry beans provided in the dataset. I then tested those assumptions through multilinear regression and see how strongly the features are correlated. Next I developed a model validation function that can be used on various learners and chose one that I think is the most effective at classifying the dry beans based on the testing results from the model validation function. Lastly, I improved the performance of my chosen learner through parameter hypertuning and feature engineering.
